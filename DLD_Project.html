                <h1 class="page-title">Wack-A-Mole</h1>
                <p>Whac-a-Mole is a popular arcade game in which a player holding a foam mallet attempts to whac moles coming out of their mole holes. In my project the moles were represented by LED’s that were switched on and when they were on the player used the switch underneath that LED to “whac” the mole. In my project proposal I stated that every time a person “hit” a mole they would receive 10 points and the score would be increased on the display. This design originally included the timer being just an internal component instead of being outputted to the seven-segment display. I decided that it would be useful to the player of the game to see how many turns of the game has been played. When the user can see this timer, they know how much time they have left to score as many points as they can. The timer counts from 0 to 25 and when it reaches 25 all the LED’s will shut off and not turn bac on until the user presses the start game button.</p>
